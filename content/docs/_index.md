sc-hacks is a library for networked live coding in supercollider. 

It provides the following features: 

1. Management and monitoring of OSC connections to OSC groups or to sensors or other software
2. Infrastructure for sharing data and code as OSC in a network of synthesis clients
3. Scaling and gui display of sensor or other live input data
4. Processing of input data for onset detection and parameter mapping
5. Coding shortcuts for allocation and chaining of control and synthesis sources
6. Management of coded algorithms and audio files as resources and presets
7. Score system for the recording, export, editing and playback of sensor data and code
8. Viewing of sound files, selection of file segments, allocation of algorithms to sound file segments
9. Preset GUI system for preview, rehearsal and simplified coding of data control linked to synthesis algorithms
